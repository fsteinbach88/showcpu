\nShowCPU is a small software tool that allows you to read your Linux systemâ€™s \
CPU information from /proc/cpuinfo.\n
This software was made as a 'homework assessment' for the job interview as a \
software engineer in the UI Software Development Team at Daimler AG, Sindelfingen, Germany.\n
To start reading you CPU information, simply click 'Load CPU Information' in the \
main window, you will notice that the information is displayed. \
In case you system has more than one CPU socket, you may \
as well read information for different sockets by indicating the socket ID in the provided field.\n
The background image is taken from shutterstock.com, all credits to 'Andrey VP'. \
The icons displayed for Intel or AMD CPUs are obtained from the german wikipedia \
website searching for 'intel' or 'amd', respectively.\n
Concept and programming by Florian Steinbach, 2017. \n
Developed using Qt Quick 5.9, GCC 5.3.1 and Qt Creator 4.4.0 on Ubuntu 16.04.03 LTS"
